=========

TheZoran, Butan and I started this game for MiniLD 48 (http://bit.ly/1hx8uqp). 
Since we were not satisfied with the state of the game when the deadline was close we didn't submit it.

We might continue working on this game later.

You can find the latest stable release build here: http://nyrrrr.github.io/Ron-Jambo/

Gameplay
=========
* At the beginning of each wave a pattern of blocks will be displayed. 
* Try to walk over the buttons to switch their color  and match that pattern.
* Shoot enemies to survive

Unity Web Player
=========
Some browsers no longer support the Unity Web Plugin. The game should give you a warning about that, though.

We are not planning to port it to WebGL or continue working on it anytime soon.

Not implemented (yet)
=========
* eyeball enemies should be able to shoot at you
* more enemy sprites were created, but their implementation was not finished
* waves should differ in difficulty
* player should be able to collect upgrades (health, weapons)
* user-friendly HUD and GUI
